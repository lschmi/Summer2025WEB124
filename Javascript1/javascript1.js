It was difficult trying to figure out what to target in the css for the if statement.
I tried style.transition first because that was the css value but that didnâ€™t work.
I eventually found a forum explaining that I needed to target not just the transition but the duration of the transition,
and a comment under the video also explained how to make it work.
