      <h2>Letting yourself become lost in a forest</h2>

      <p><i>By Jos Cerelius</i></p>

      <p>In our hectic, meticulously planned life, there is a thing that is easy to do, and yet we rarely do it. A way to lose control, get in touch with nature and disconnect fully at the same time. Imagine this: You walk into a forest, leave the well-trodden trails behind, and set off to explore the mysterious forest. Let yourself wander and enjoy places where very few people have been before you. If you have a fear of getting truly lost, fear not. In my experience, I’ve always been able to pick up a GPS signal on my phone if needed. Alternatively, bring a map and compass, and for longer excursions, consider packing some basic camping gear along with plenty of snacks and water.</p>

      <p>So, what is the beauty of getting lost in a forest? It reminds us, that there is an entire world around us, unplanned, uncared for, and mostly untouched by humans, and yet thriving. The forest quiets when you walk through it, but the moment you sit down, and quietly observe the forest, it comes alive. It gets used your presence, and as a result, you’ll hear the entire cacophony a forest can offer to you. The air hums with the symphony of nature. You will see life all around you, a buzzling outside of what we normally see. Birds flying beautifully and elegantly through the forest, weaving through trees as if they Luke Skywalker riding Pod Racers. Insects crawling curiously on you, allowing you to see some truly interesting species. Some of these species look entirely alien to us, like visitors from different planets.</p>

      <p>You’ll get to hear the cacophony of the forest, opening up like a grand orchestra. The rustle of the trees, leaves slowly falling down, critters running through the undergrowth. The wind caressing you like an affectionate hand. There’s something extraordinary about places untouched by human interference, where nature reigns in its raw and untamed glory. You can find it in the heights of mountain hikes, the depths of forest exploration, or the quiet depths of a dive. These experiences remind us that beyond our structured lives, there exists a world indifferent to calendars, unfazed by our achievements or mistakes. A world where time isn’t measured by watches but by the sun’s journey across the sky. The beauty of losing yourself in this timeless realm lies in its simplicity — just being there, immersed in the forest, free to explore, nothing to distract you but your own thoughts. Sit down where you want, and try to remember the buzzling of streets, the honking of horns and all the people you see in a day, only to realize how quickly the memory of these have faded. Soon they seem as a distant memory, as you immerse yourself more and more, in this untamed beauty.</p>

      <p>You find a tree, tipped over. Wondering whether the old anecdote; “if a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it does it make a sound”, might be true or false. As you walk closer you see something amazing unfold. The once mighty tree, now humbled in its horizontal posture, has become a haven for a thriving ecosystem. Beetles scuttle across the bark, bugs navigate the intricate network of exposed roots, and tiny creatures create a bustling microcosm amidst the decay - a reminder, that even in death, life will prevail. A never-ending cycle, going round and round — all without the need for human intervention. In this moment, you contemplate our role in this ecosystem. As the dominant species, we have indeed tamed and sculpted the majority of the Earth. Yet, standing before this fallen giant, you can’t help but feel a profound sense of humility. What are we, after all, in comparison to the boundless, interconnected wonders of nature?</p>

      <p>We often perceive ourselves as masters of the world, builders of civilizations, and conquerors of nature. But in this forest, where every fallen tree becomes a sanctuary for life, where every rustling leaf holds a story, and every bird’s song is a symphony of the wild, our supremacy seems trivial. Our email inbox seems insignificant, and there is an overarching want to just reconnect with something inside of us. To turn back the time and rejoin the primal cycle we see around us. The forest whispers tales of resilience and adaptability. It teaches us that life persists, not because of us, but in spite of us.</p>

      <p>Our attempts to assert control and order on nature often seem mindless, considering this is a process that have unfolded for millennia. The forest is a living testament to the intricate dance of birth, growth, death, rebirth, control and chaos all living in a weird form of harmony— a harmony we are only beginning to comprehend.</p>
